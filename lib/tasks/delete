That the language is designed to accomodate the computer, first and foremost. That therefore, we, the coders, are foreigners, seeking citizenship in the computer’s locale. It’s the computer’s language and we are translators for the world.\n\nBut what do you call the language when your brain begins to think in that language? When you start to use the language’s own words and colloquialisms to express yourself. Say, the computer can’t do that. How can it be the computer’s language? It is ours, we speak it natively!\n\nWe can no longer truthfully call it a computer language. It is coderspeak. It is the language of our thoughts.\"\n\n_why's poignant guide to ruby" },
